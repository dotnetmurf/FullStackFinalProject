Would you like me to implement any of these recommendations? I can start with the high-priority items like the ErrorHandlerService and ErrorAlert component!

I want to implement these recommendations one-at-a-time. Each one must have a successful dotnet build before starting the next one. Please start with Add ErrorHandlerService for centralized error translation.
