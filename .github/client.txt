The ClientApp project needs to implement the CRUD endpoints available from the ServerApp. For this phase of development, only the essential elements of the CRUD operations need to be implemented in the ClientApp. Further enhancements can be added during later phases

Product DTOs are available in `ServerApp/Product.cs`

Each page will need proper routing, error handling. The components will form a complete CRUD interface for managing products in the system.

New Blazor Components Required:
- Product List page: Shows all products with Details navigation
- Product Details page: Shows single product with Edit/Delete options
- Edit Product page: For modifying product records
- Delete Product page: For removing products
- All pages should use Bootstrap styling
- After Edit/Delete actions, redirect to updated Products List page

Reusable components:

Pages (in Pages folder):
1. `Products.razor` (list page)
2. `ProductDetails.razor` (details page)
3. `EditProduct.razor` (edit page)
4. `DeleteProduct.razor` (delete page)

Shared Components (in Shared folder):
1. `ProductCard.razor`
2. `ProductForm.razor`
