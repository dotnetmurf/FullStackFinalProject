The ServerApp/Program.cs file has been updated to include new endpoints for managing products. These endpoints allow clients to create, read details, update, and delete products. The new endpoints follow RESTful conventions and include proper error handling and validation.

The ClientApp needs the following updates:

1. Model and Service Updates:
1a. The Product class needs to be refactored out of ProductService.cs into its own .cs file in a ClientApp/Models folder
  * Must match server DTOs from ServerApp/Product.cs
  * Include appropriate validation attributes
  * Add XML documentation for the model

1b. ProductService.cs updates:
  * Add new public async Task<Product> methods for CRUD operations
  * Configure base URL for API endpoints in constructor
  * Implement comprehensive error handling with retry policy
  * Add caching with 5-minute duration for frequently accessed data
  * Register service in Program.cs with appropriate scope
  * Add XML documentation for the service and methods

2. Component Updates:
All components should use Bootstrap styling and include proper XML documentation.

2a. Navigation:
- Update NavMenu.razor to include new Product management links
- Define routes: 
  * /products (list)
  * /products/{id} (details)
