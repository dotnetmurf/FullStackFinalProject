The ClientApp project needs to implement the CRUD endpoints available from the ServerApp. For this phase of development, only the essential elements of the CRUD operations need to be implemented in the ClientApp. Further enhancements can be added during later phases

Product DTOs are available in `ServerApp/Product.cs`

2. New Blazor Components Required:
- Product List page: Shows all products with Details navigation
- Product Details page: Shows single product with Edit/Delete options
- Edit Product page: For modifying product records
- Delete Product page: For removing products
- All pages should use Bootstrap styling
- After Edit/Delete actions, redirect to updated Products List page

Each page will need proper routing, error handling, and integration with the `ProductService` for data operations. The components will form a complete CRUD interface for managing products in the system.

Reusable components:

Pages (in Pages folder):
1. `Products.razor` (list page)
2. `ProductDetails.razor` (details page)
3. `EditProduct.razor` (edit page)
4. `DeleteProduct.razor` (delete page)

Shared Components (in Shared folder):
1. `ProductCard.razor`
2. `ProductForm.razor`



dotnetmurf: Am I missing any important details in this list of updates?


dotnetmurf: Can you incorporate these missing aspects into this .txt file?


dotnetmurf: Please create a detailed, step-by-step update.prompt.md markdown file for Copilot to use.


dotnetmurf: Are any components created for this update, or only .razor pages/

GitHub Copilot: Looking at the current requirements, I notice we should add some reusable components beyond just the pages. Let me update the prompt to include specific component creation. 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
I've updated the components section to better separate pages from reusable components. Here's the structure:

Pages (in Pages folder):
1. `Products.razor` (list page)
2. `ProductDetails.razor` (details page)
3. `EditProduct.razor` (edit page)
4. `DeleteProduct.razor` (delete page)

Shared Components (in Shared folder):
1. `StatusModal.razor`
2. `LoadingIndicator.razor`
3. `ProductCard.razor`
4. `ProductForm.razor`
